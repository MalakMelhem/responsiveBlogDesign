# Responsive Web Design

This is a practice website project in the "Learn Responsive Web Design" course by Kevin Powell, and it was an excellent practice in coding from scratch to build responsive websites. 

It starts with explaining the core concepts needed to start thinking responsively, and then it takes you through every single step in building a professional responsive website.
- CSS Fundamentals
- Starting to think responsively
- Stepping Up Our Style
- Taking Flexbox to the Next Level
- CSS Grid: The ultimate layout tool
- Taking it to the Next Level

The website is a blog with the title **Living the simple life** 
and it contains 3 pages:
- Home **index.html**
- about me **about-me.html**
- Recent posts **recent-post.html**

The website uses a mobile-first design approach, along with media Query basics and a responsive layout with flex-direction, picks which unit to use and where ems and rems, and controls the width of images min-width and max-width.
